## Description

This repository contains the code and resources related to the research paper titled "Augmented Street-Level  Imagery with Points of Interest (Data and Resources Track)" The paper explores a method to generate new street-level imagery data using street-view images and annotating them with Points of Interest (POIS). This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contact information for further inquiries.

## üî• Data Curation Code - Augment Mapillary Street-level Imagery with POIs

### Setup and Environment

To set up the environment for running the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/NeginZarbakhsh/Augmented-Street-Level-Imagery-with-Points-of-Interest.git
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory: cd Augmented-Street-Level-Imagery-with-Points-of-Interest
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to run the below codes to reproduce data explained in the paper:

	- Gathering all images in the neighborhood of specific POI coordinate: [Mapillary/Mapillary_image_Retrieval.py](Mapillary/Mapillary_image_Retrieval.py).
	- Filtering images based on POIs building footprints: [Mapillary/Filtering_POI_Polygon_based_Approach.py](Mapillary/Filtering_POI_Polygon_based_Approach.py).
	- Selecting selective images for balance data:[Mapillary/filtering_selective_images.py](Mapillary/filtering_selective_images.py).
	- Adding road network from Open Street Map (OSM): [Mapillary/Adding-road-attributes.py](Mapillary/Adding-road-attributes.py)
	- Detect Objects through Mapillary API: [Mapillary/Mapillary_detectedobjects.py](Mapillary/Mapillary_detectedobjects.py)
